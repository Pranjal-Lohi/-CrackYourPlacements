**Crack Your Internship & Crack Your Placement Challenge**
Excited to announce that Iâ€™m taking the #CrackYourInternship and #CrackYourPlacement challenge starting today [25-7-2024] for the next 45-60 days! ðŸ’ª

**About the Challenge**
This repository will document my journey through the #CrackYourInternship and #CrackYourPlacement challenge. I will be sharing my progress, resources, and insights as I prepare for internships and placements.

**Structure of the Repository**
The repository is organized as follows:

Daily Progress: Logs of daily activities, tasks completed.
Code Snippets: Solutions to coding problems, algorithm implementations, and other relevant code, with comments and explanations of my approaches.

The problems solved on that day.
A brief description or comments within the code explaining the approach taken.
**How to Use**
Feel free to explore the repository and review the solutions. Each solution file contains comments explaining the logic and approach used to solve the problem. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
